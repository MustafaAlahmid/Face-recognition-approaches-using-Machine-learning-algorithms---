# Face recognition approaches using Machine learning algorithms  â€‹

first approach: 
using MTCNN model to detect faces then use the faceNet model to creat the embaddings then use the KNN or SVM to make the prediction

secon approach:
using MTCNN to detect faces then use then train a CNN model to predict the faces
